Graph Algorithms implemented so far:

| Algorithm | Description | Extra Data Structures Implemented | Time Complexity 
| :---:        |     ---      |     ---      |   :---: 
| **Depth First Search**   | The aim of BFS algorithm is to traverse the graph as close as possible to the root node. |  | *O(m+n)* 
| **Breadth First Search** | The aim of BFS algorithm is to traverse the graph as close as possible to the root node.  | Queue | *O(m+n)*  
| **Dijkstra** | An Algorithm for solving the single-source shortest paths problem in a graph with non-negative weights | Priority Queue | *O(nlogn + m)* 
| **Kruskal's**  | Given a weighted undirected graph. We want to find a subtree of this graph which connects all vertices and has the least weight of all possible spanning trees. This spanning tree is called a minimum spanning tree. | Disjoint Set Union  | *O(mlogn)* |

***n*** being the number of nodes and ***m*** number of edges in the graph
